1. [BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation](/NLP/BLEU.pdf)
> Abstract(From the paper itself): Human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive. Human evaluations can take months to Ô¨Ånish and involve human labor that can not be reused. We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evalu-
ation, and that has little marginal cost perrun. We present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.
