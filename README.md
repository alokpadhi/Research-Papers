1. [BLEU: a Method for Automatic Evaluation of Machine Translation](/NLP/BLEU.pdf)
> Abstract(From the paper itself): Human evaluations of machine translation are extensive but expensive. Human evaluations can take months to ﬁnish and involve human labor that can not be reused. We propose a method of automatic machine translation evaluation that is quick, inexpensive, and language-independent, that correlates highly with human evalu-
ation, and that has little marginal cost perrun. We present this method as an automated understudy to skilled human judges which substitutes for them when there is need for quick or frequent evaluations.

2. [Sequence to Sequence learning with Neural Networks](/NLP/seq2seq_NMT.pdf)
> Encoder-Decoder Architecture, having two LSTM used. One LSTM used for Encoder part and the other LSTM used for Decoder. This paper shows how we can use this seq2seq architecture to solve problems with different sequence length for input and output. Tha paper has demonstrated the French-English translation task by using this architecture.
